                                    Traditional systems rely on prefix filtering and static ranking but often overwhelm users with
                                    lengthy, alphabetically sorted lists. Recent research has introduced LR-parsing-based approaches
                                    that derive completion candidates from language syntax and compute their ranks using open-
                                    source programs; however, these methods only suggest structural candidates, requiring manual
                                    refinement into complete code. To address this, we propose a hybrid method that integrates LR
                                    parsing with LLMs to enhance accuracy and usability. Our approach refines structural candidates
                                    using LR parsing into textual code suggestions via an LLM, referencing a database of ranked
                                    candidates from open-source programs. This combines the syntactic precision of LR parsing
                                    with the generative capabilities of LLMs. This study examines whether LLMs benefit from LR
                                    structural candidates in code completion. By comparing completions with and without these
                                    candidates, we assess their impact. Building on prior research, we also explore how leveraging
                                    top-ranked structural candidates can effectively enhance LLM-based code completion precision.
                                    We also demonstrate our method through VSCode extensions for Microsoft Small Basic and C.
                                    As a language-agnostic solution, our system applies to any language with a defined LR grammar.
                                    Our findings suggest that integrating LR parsing with LLM-based completion improves both
                                    accuracy and usability, paving the way for more effective code completion in modern IDEs.

                                    developers in improving coding efficiency. While traditional methods rely on prefix-based filtering
                                    and static ranking, LR-parsing-based approaches offer structural candidates from language syntax
                                    as code suggestions to the user, but are limited by manual refinement. Recently, large language

                                    suggesting LLMs may already internalize grammar or need alternative evaluation.

Effective and timely treatment of DR relies on precise and automated detection systems that can assess disease severity from retinal fundus images. Traditional clinical approaches are often time-consuming, and earlier texture attention models may struggle to accurately detect subtle features, such as microaneurysms or abnormal blood vessel patterns, which are crucial for early diagnosis. To address this, we proposed the STMFNet model, a hierarchical framework designed for classifying 11 stages of DR severity. The model combines two primary mechanisms: The Texture Spatial Attention Network, which focuses on identifying critical texture features related to DR while minimizing irrelevant background information through attention gating, and the EfficientNet backbone with Multi-Scale Feature Fusion, which captures a wide range of image patterns. By extracting and fusing features from different layers of EfficientNet-V1 BO, the model effectively learns both low (e.g., edges, blobs) and high (e.g., objects, patterns) level representations. These features are further refined through spatial multi-scale attention, and the final classification into 11 DR stages is achieved through a Fully Connected Network (FCN) and SoftMax. Our experimental results show that STMFNet significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art models on the publicly available Kaggle fundus dataset, demonstrating its potential for reliable DR diagnosis in clinical settings.

The psychological struggle faced by students, is effected by various factors, including disruptions to daily routines and academic activities, increased reliance on smartphones and the internet, limited social interaction, and confinement to their homes. These impediments reflect a broader issue of imbalance in cognitive health status among them during the pandemic. In Bangladesh, despite having the necessary population to study, understanding the impact of Covid-19 on the mental health status of university students has been limited. Hence, it is imperative to diagnose mental health issues and deal with the underlying reasons in order to enhance students’ psychological well-being, which leads to academic achievement. Nowadays, Artificial Intelligence (AI) based prediction models have the potential to play a crucial role in predicting mental state early. The purpose of the study is to explore the following effects of the pandemic on the mental health of Bangladeshi university students using Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) techniques. A reliable AI prediction system requires real-world data, that was collected by a survey through a Google form (online questionnaires) among 400 students of 16 universities, and the respondents were 253. In this paper, after data preprocessing, ten widely known ML and four DL models were developed to automatically and accurately predict mental well-being during or after the Covid-19 circumstance. According to our findings, the Random Forest (RF) algorithm and Siamese Neural Networks (SNNs) outperformed other models in terms of accuracy (86% and 75%). Additionally, Chi-Square test was conducted, which revealed the five most common and significant predictors (“Stable family income”, “Disruption of daily life”, “Own income”, “Sleep status”, and “Fear of getting infected with Covid-19”) of psychological health conditions. Overall, this work could assist university administrations, government agencies, and health specialists in taking appropriate measures to understand and maintain students’ mental health. This research also suggests proper monitoring, government support, and social awareness during and after the worldwide epidemic to keep an excellent mental health state of university students.

                                    their own volition, the company suffers greatly from various dimensions.
                                    Nowadays, we have seen a huge change in companies due to COVID-19;
                                    employees are getting fired or resigning voluntarily. It is a big issue to
                                    keep the productivity constant of a company or individual as human
                                    resources (HR) has to spend a lot of time, from the selection process
                                    to the training process. In these circumstances, minimizing the attrition
                                    rate is one of the primary concerns of the Human Resource department,
                                    which deals with staffing, development, and compensation. From this
                                    point of view, more research projects have been done through statistical

                                    was created today to address the problem of
                                    maintaining significant quantities of energy
                                    consumption with the help of emerging nations.
                                    Smart cities, like the smart grid, have an energy
                                    infrastructure that is arguably the single most
                                    important feature in any city. Smart cities
                                    depend on a smart grid to ensure resilient
                                    delivery of energy to supply their many
                                    functions, including those responsible for public
                                    safety and the public. It consists of smart
                                    distribution boards and circuit breakers
                                    integrated with home control and demand
                                    response, where load control switches and smart
                                    appliances are located. The smart grid vision is
                                    supported by the use of information and
                                    communication technology. In this article, the
                                    capabilities and technologies of the smart grid
                                    are compared across several machine learning
                                    and deep learning technologies. The deep
                                    learning (ANN) methodology was used to find
                                    the best approaches for forecasting grid
                                    stability. Various supervised machine learning
                                    classifiers are utilized to estimate accuracy,
                                    AUC-ROC, and other metrics. According to the
                                    investigation, deep learning-based estimations
                                    were actually more accurate than supervised
                                    learning-based ones. As a result, accurate power
                                    consumption estimation makes sure the entire

                                    mentally by the outbreak of COVID-19. Our university students' mental health, on the other
                                    hand, is not given the same level of attention as their physical health. The purpose of the study
                                    is to explore the impacts of this pandemic on the mental health state of Bangladeshi university
                                    students. In this paper, after data preprocessing, several machine learning models are developed
                                    to automatically and accurately predict mental health status. We observed that the Random
                                    Forest algorithm performed the best accuracy (>85%) to predict mental health conditions
                                    during or after the COVID-19 circumstance. We also conducted statistical analyses, which
                                    revealed the most common and significant predictors (Stable family income, Disruption of
                                    daily life, Own income, Sleep status) of mental health conditions during Covid-19. Overall,
                                    this work could assist university administrations, government agencies, and health specialists
                                    in taking appropriate steps to enhance our students' mental health. This research also suggests
                                    proper monitoring, government support, and social awareness during the pandemic and after
                                    the pandemic to keep an excellent mental health state of university students.

                                <p class="u-align-left-xs u-text u-text-2">This project introduces two new Visual Studio Code (VSCode) extensions designed to enhance code completion capabilities for Microsoft Small Basic and C, addressing the limitations of traditional and AI-based tools like Copilot. Unlike standard VSCode extensions that rely on user-typed prefixes or language-specific grammar assumptions, the proposed extensions provide syntax-structure-based code suggestions without requiring initial input, thereby aiding users unfamiliar with programming grammar.

                                    Built using the YAPB parser builder tool and LR grammars, the system uses WithinTop3Guide to present the top three context-aware suggestions. It also features an interactive preview of candidates—displaying both identifier names and decomposable expressions—to improve comprehension and usability for both novice and advanced users. The extensions aim to provide grammar-compliant, generative AI-driven code completions and are fully open-source on GitHub. </p>

                                <p class="u-align-left-xs u-text u-text-2">The project utilizes NLP techniques to analyze the text content of social media posts and classify them as either cyberbullying or non-cyberbullying. NLP encompasses a range of methods and algorithms that enable computers to understand and process human language. By applying techniques such as text preprocessing, sentiment analysis, part-of-speech tagging, and machine learning, the project aims to extract meaningful features from text data and develop a robust model for cyberbullying detection.

                                    The development of the model involves several steps. Firstly, a comprehensive dataset of social media posts, labeled as either cyberbullying or non-cyberbullying, is collected and prepared for analysis. The dataset may include various forms of text data, such as tweets, comments, or forum posts, from different social media platforms.
                                    
                                    Next, the collected data is preprocessed to remove noise, handle punctuation, and transform the text into a format suitable for analysis. NLP techniques, such as tokenization, stemming, and

                                <p class="u-align-left-xs u-text u-text-2">The Iris flower dataset consists of measurements of sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width for three different species of Iris flowers: Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica. The goal of the project is to develop a deep learning model that can analyze these feature measurements and accurately predict the corresponding Iris flower species. In this project, a deep learning model will be designed and trained using the Iris flower dataset. The model will be built using popular deep learning frameworks such as TensorFlow or PyTorch, which provide a wide range of tools and functionalities for constructing and training neural networks.</p>
